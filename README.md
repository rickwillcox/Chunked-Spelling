# Chunked Spelling 
_yep, literally the best name I could come up with_

### Visualise words you struggle spell easier whilst browsing the web.

I've struggled with spelling my whole life, some words just never seem to sink in. This is my attempt at fixing that. This chrome extension allows you to create a list of your commonly misspelled words along with a the schema to break up that word into the most logical chunks for you to digest. For example the word `definitely` you could choose to have to broken up in multiple ways `def-in-ite-ly` or `de-finite-ly` etc... the choice is yours. For me personally its often not how its pronounces or the syllables themselves, as its not pronouncation I struggle with its the spelling. Once you select the words (or just use my default list), as you browse the web those words will be highlighted automatically in the chunks you previously defined. The goal is to without effort just casually get more exposure to the words you struggle to spell as you go about your daily browsing, whilst also getting a bit of help from the highlighting. 

* **Will this actually help me spell better?** No idea. 
* **Why is it written in JS?** I thought this would be a 15 minute PoC and every additional 15 minutes that passed and I thought I should just convert to TS, I managed to convince myself it wouldnt be that much longer. This happened about 20 times.
* **Is there bugs?** Probably.. its written in js with no tests.
* **Future plans for this project** Likely none.
* **There a lot of code duplication..** Yep, works on my machine though.

The irony of there probably being multiple spelling errors in the text above is not lost on me I can assure you.
